zim-mendeley-plugin
===================

[Mendeley](http://www.mendeley.com) is a free cross-platform desktop reference and paper management program. This plugin allows the user to insert Mendeley citations that link directly to the Mendeley desktop application or to a DOI URL. This is accomplished by interfacing with the Mendeley application, which must be open for the plugin to function. 

Page-specific bibliographies may be generated based on all of the citations found on a page. Any reference style from http://www.zotero.org/styles may be chosen.

The plugin may be installed (like all [Zim plugins](https://github.com/jaap-karssenberg/zim-wiki/wiki/Plugins)) by cloning it to one of Zim's plugin search directories, like ~/.local/share/zim/plugins on Linux.
