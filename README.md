zim-mendeley-plugin
===================

[Mendeley](http://www.mendeley.com) is a free cross-platform desktop reference and paper management program. This plugin allows the user to insert Mendeley citations that link directly to the Mendeley desktop application or to a DOI URL. This is accomplished by interfacing with the Mendeley application, which must be open for the plugin to function. 

Page-specific bibliographies may be generated based on all of the citations found on a page. Any reference style from http://www.zotero.org/styles may be chosen.
